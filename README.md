Impact of Climate Change-Related Heat Stress on Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Patient Cohort Growth in Urban Areas

Abstract: This research overview examines the potential link between climate change—specifically heat stress in urban areas—and the growth of patient cohorts diagnosed with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. By analyzing retrospective clinical data alongside urban climate trends, the study explores whether extreme heat events may exacerbate inflammatory processes, contributing to increased disease incidence and severity.

Introduction: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic inflammatory conditions influenced by genetic and environmental factors. With ongoing climate change, urban centers experience more frequent and intense heat waves, leading to heat stress. Such conditions may disrupt skin integrity, promote dehydration, and trigger systemic inflammatory responses. This study investigates the association between urban heat stress and an observed rise in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis cases, suggesting that climate change could be a contributing factor to the growth of these patient cohorts.

Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using electronic health records from several urban healthcare facilities over a ten-year period. Concurrently, climate data—such as temperature records and heat index values—were collected from local meteorological sources. Incidence and prevalence rates of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis were correlated with periods of elevated heat stress. Additional variables, including air pollution levels and urban density, were also considered to account for confounding factors.

Results: Preliminary findings indicate a temporal association between episodes of extreme heat and an increase in clinical visits and new diagnoses of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Urban areas experiencing more pronounced heat waves showed higher incidence rates. While causality cannot be definitively established from this observational data, the trends suggest that heat stress may amplify inflammatory responses, thereby contributing to the growth of these patient cohorts.

Discussion: The observed correlation supports the hypothesis that climate change-induced heat stress is an environmental trigger for exacerbating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Possible mechanisms include dehydration affecting the skin barrier, heightened systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Urban environments—with their elevated pollution levels and inherent stressors—may further intensify these effects. These insights underscore the importance of considering environmental factors in disease management and the need for targeted public health interventions in urban settings.

Urban areas experience the "heat island" effect, where temperatures can be several degrees higher than surrounding regions. This phenomenon, exacerbated by climate change, results in more frequent and intense heat waves that impose significant heat stress on populations.

For patients with psoriasis, high temperatures can lead to increased dehydration and compromised skin barrier function, which may trigger flare-ups. In psoriatic arthritis, heat stress is thought to exacerbate systemic inflammation. Studies have observed that environmental factors, including temperature extremes and humidity, can account for up to 40% of the variability in disease severity.

Some key facts include:
• Research indicates that during periods of extreme heat, psoriasis flare frequency can increase by 15-25%.
• Urban heat islands can elevate local temperatures by 1-3°C compared to surrounding areas, potentially intensifying inflammatory responses.
• Retrospective analyses from urban healthcare settings show seasonal peaks in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis symptoms that align with heat wave events.
• Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha and IL-6) are observed in patients under heat stress, suggesting a biological mechanism linking high temperatures to disease exacerbation.

Conclusion: This research highlights a potential link between urban heat stress due to climate change and the increasing growth of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patient cohorts. The findings call for more comprehensive, prospective studies to further delineate the mechanisms at play and to develop strategies aimed at mitigating the health impacts of climate change on inflammatory diseases.
